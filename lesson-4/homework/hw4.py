The error message in your screenshot says:

“A file with the same name already exists. Please choose a different name and try again.”

This happens because GitHub won’t let you create a new file with the exact same name as an existing one in the repository on the same branch. Here’s what you can do:

Check if the file already exists

Make sure hw4.py is not already in the repository. If it is, you don’t need to create a new file; you can edit the existing one instead.

Rename the file

If you want to keep both versions, rename your new file to something like hw4_v2.py or hw4_exercises.py.

Edit directly instead of creating a new file

Click on the existing hw4.py file in the repository, then click the pencil icon to edit it. You can add your dictionary and set exercises there, then commit the changes.

Branch options

You can still create a new branch, but the file name itself must be unique in that branch. Even in a new branch, GitHub checks if a file with the same name already exists in the main branch.

If you want, I can suggest a quick way to rename your commit and avoid this error, so you can successfully propose the changes. Do you want me to do that?
